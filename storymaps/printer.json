Workers were a particular concern: they could derail or ruin production by fighting, drinking, or making careless mistakes. Most printers, including Plantin, set rules and regulations to ensure their workers were behaving properly. Violators were punished with fines, furloughs, or unemployment if they did anything to endanger the production of a profitable book.</span></p>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"icon": "//uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/f16f101e1b9e4f19898b53b294e8d1dd/novrep-printer/_images/Red Dabbers 2.png", "iconSize": [48, 46.93333333333333], "lat": 72.50172235139388, "line": true, "lon": -49.5703125, "use_custom_marker": true, "zoom": 2}, "media": {"caption": "", "credit": "<I>Der Papiermacher (Papermakers)</i> from Paul von Stetten, <i>Der Mensch in seinen verschiedenen Lagen und St\u00e4nden f\u00fcr die Jugend geschildert</i>.
